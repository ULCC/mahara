<h3>Static pages</h3>
<p>Some built-in pages of your site may be edited dynamically by a site administrator.
If you wish to customise the content of a built-in page (About, Home, Logged-out home, Privacy statement, Terms and conditions)
from the default text, select the page you wish to modify and edit it using the editor. Ensure you save your changes before
loading another page or exiting the static pages area.</p>
<p>For institution members, the contents of these pages may be overridden by institution administrators using the
institution static pages feature.</p>
