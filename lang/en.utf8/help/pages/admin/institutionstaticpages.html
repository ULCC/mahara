<h3>Institution static pages</h3>
<p>Some built-in pages of your site may be edited dynamically by a site or institution administrator.
If you wish to customise the content of a built-in page (About, Home, Logged-out home, Privacy statement, Terms and conditions)
from the default text, select the page you wish to modify and edit it using the editor. Ensure you save your changes before
loading another page or exiting the static pages area.</p>
<p>Changes you make here will be reflected in the page content viewed by members of your institution. They will not
be shown to members of other institutions.</p>
<p>If you tick "Use site default" for a specific page, then your institution members will see the site's default version
of that page.</p>
