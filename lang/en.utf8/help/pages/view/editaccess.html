<h3>Edit page access</h3>
<p>You can control who has access to your page and when. By default, only you can see your page. You can share your page with the public, logged-in users, your institution(s), groups or your friends by clicking the appropriate "Add" button. You can also assign access to individual groups or users by using the search tool.</p>
<p>Access dates can be set, allowing you to make your page available for a specified period such as a course year, a project timeline, or even for one day only. All dates are optional. Individual users can be granted access by multiple access rules.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Nigel is in the group "The Coolpeople's Club". If you allow him to access your page today and allow "The Coolpeople's Club" to access your page tomorrow, he will be able to access the page on both days.</p>
