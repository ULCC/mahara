<p>Designing your page layout enables you to personalise the way in which your resources and information can be displayed. For example if you wish to display only one of your journal entries, click on the "Journals" tab, then drag the "Journal entry" block into your page area. Remember to click "Save" as you add new elements to your page.</p>
<p>As you build up the content of your layout, you can check on how it will look by clicking on "Display page". Click on "Edit this page" to continue editing.</p>
