<h3>Friends control</h3>
<p>Choose whether other users may add this user to their friends list. If the user is added to a friends list, the owner of that list is added to the user's list as well. When the user removes someone from their friends list, the user is also removed from the other user's list. Choose either:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody may add you as a friend:</strong> no one may add this user to their list.</p>
<p><strong>New friends require my authorisation:</strong> the user's authorisation is needed for the user to be added to a list. If the user approves, they will be added to a friends list.</p>
<p><strong>New friends are automatically authorised:</strong> anyone may add the user to their list.</p>
