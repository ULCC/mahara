<h3>Friends control</h3>
<p>Choose whether other users may add these users to their friends list. If they are added to a friends list, the owner of that list is added to their list as well. When the users remove someone from their friends list, they are also removed from the other user's list. Choose one of the following as default option:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody may add me as a friend:</strong> no one may add these users to their list.</p>
<p><strong>New friends require my authorisation:</strong> the users' authorisation is needed for them to be added to a list. If they approve, they will be added to another user's list.</p>
<p><strong>New friends are automatically authorised:</strong> anyone may add these users to their list.</p>
