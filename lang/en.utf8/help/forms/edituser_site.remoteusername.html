<h3>Username for external authentication</h3>
<p>When a user is authenticated by some service external to the site,
this field contains the identifier for the user on the remote service.
It is possible for a user to have several remote usernames stored in
Mahara, but each one must be associated with a different external
authentication method.</p>
<p>The current rules for the update of this field are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you wipe the contents of this field and submit your changes,
  the external username associated with the selected authentication
  method will be reset to the default username.</li>
  <li>If you update the contents of this field, the external username
  will be reset for this authentication method, or a new one will be
  created if it doesn't exist yet.</li>
</ul>
