<h3>Display remote avatars</h3>

<p>If this option is enabled,
the <a href="http://www.gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> online service will be used to display profile pictures for users who don't have one set. This allows users to set their profile picture once on the Gravatar site instead of having to do it on every Mahara and online service individually. If Gravatar does not have a picture for that user, then the default Mahara picture will be shown.</p>

<h4>Reasons to turn it off</h4>

<p>This option requires both the <b>user</b> and the <b>web server</b> to have access to the Gravatar server (<code>http://www.gravatar.com</code> or <code>https://secure.gravatar.com</code>). In installations such as locked-down intranets, where such access is not available, enabling this option would simply add extra delays.</p>

<h4>Custom avatar server</h4>

<p>If you have a custom avatar server which implements the Gravatar
protocol, you may specify its base URL in your config.php file:</p>

<p><code>$cfg->remoteavatarbaseurl = 'http://example.com/avatar/';</code></p>
