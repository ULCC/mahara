<h3>Institution expiry date</h3>
<p>If you specify an expiry date for this institution, two things will happen. Once the <em>warning time for institution expiry</em> has been reached, site and institution administrators will be emailed about this institution's impending expiry.</p>
<p>If the <em>auto-suspend expired institutions</em> option is set, then once the expiry date has been reached, this institution will be automatically suspended, and users of this institution will no longer be able to log in.</p>
<p>The <em>warning time for institution expiry</em> and <em>auto-suspend expired institutions</em> options can be found on the site options administration page.</p>
