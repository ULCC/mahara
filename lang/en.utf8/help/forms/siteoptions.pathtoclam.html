<h3>Path to clam</h3>
<p>The file system path to <code>clamscan</code> or <code>clamdscan</code> for
virus checking. It is assumed that a failure of clam to run will mean that a file
should be treated as a virus, and a quarantine directory will be automatically set
up by your Mahara installation.</p>
<p>For security reasons this setting cannot be changed via the web. You will need to
set it in your <tt>config.php</tt> file, as follows:<p>
<p><tt>$cfg->pathtoclam = '/path/to/your/clamscan';</tt></p>
