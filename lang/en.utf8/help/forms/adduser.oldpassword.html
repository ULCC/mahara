<h3>Passwords</h3>
<p>To change your login password, first enter your current password here, then enter your preferred new password in both the other boxes.</p>
<p>Your password must be at least six characters long. Passwords are case sensitive and must be different from your username.</p>
<p>For good security, consider using a passphrase. A passphrase is a sentence rather than a single word. Consider using a favourite quote or listing two (or more!) of your favourite things separated by spaces.</p>
