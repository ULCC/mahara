<h3>Spammer probation status</h3>
<p>This setting controls whether the user is considered to be on probation as a possible spammer. Newly self-registered users start out with a certain number of "probation points" on their account. While they have any probation points, they are considered a probationary user and cannot create public pages in their portfolio or post links or images to potentially public content such as comments, wall posts, or forum posts.</p>
<p>Each time a probationary user makes a post in a forum, and the post is replied to by a non-probationary user, the probationary user loses one probation point. When the number of points reaches zero, they are no longer on probation.</p>
<p>Probation points have no effect on users who have staff or administrator status.</p>
