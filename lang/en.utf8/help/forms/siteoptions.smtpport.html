<h3>SMTP port</h3>
<p>If your SMTP server uses a port number different from 25, you may specify it here.</p>
<p>When encryption is enabled, the default ports are 465 for SSL and 587 for TLS. You only need to specify a port number if it is different from these. Check the correct settings with your mail service provider.</p>
<p>This field may be disabled if overridden by a setting in your config.php file.</p>
