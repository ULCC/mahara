<h3>Default account lifetime</h3>
<p>If set, user accounts will expire after this amount of time from when they were created. When a user account is expired, the user cannot log in. This time may be specified in days, weeks, months, and years, or "no end date" may be selected where user accounts should never expire.</p>
