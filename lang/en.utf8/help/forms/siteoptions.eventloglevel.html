<h3>Log events</h3>
<p>Events are generated every time the user does anything significant on the site, such as editing a page.</p>
<p>Optionally, a log of these events can be kept. You can keep either all events, which could be a lot of data and database activity on a busy site, or only those events pertaining to the masquerading of an administrator as another user when using the "Log in as" functionality.
This log is kept in the event_log table in the database. A report of masquerading sessions is available in the "User reports" section of the "User search" administration page.</p>
<p>No matter which setting you choose, all events are still logged in the access log.</p>
