<h3>Warning time for institution expiry</h3>
<p>If set, a warning message will be sent to the site and institution administrators this amount of time before an institution is due to expire and be suspended. This time may be specified in days, weeks, months, years, or "no end date" may be selected where institutions should not receive a warning before their institution expires.</p>
