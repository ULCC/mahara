TODOs for export LEAP plugin
============================

* Export views properly!
 - flag artefacts in the export properly that aren't otherwise surrounded by <a> or similar (e.g. blogs)
 - rewrite links to views when the views are part of the export
 - export special attributes on blocktypes to help us detect them on the way in (do this in combination with advanced import)
 - what about smilies?
* Default profile icon/exporting links between users and depictions of themselves (email thread on list discussing this currently)
 - If the person element was linked to some entries with depicts: relationships, then we wouldn't have to look for profile icons
* Documentation
 - developer
 - end-user
