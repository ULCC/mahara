<h3>Elasticsearch analyzer</h3>

<p>The Elasticsearch analyzer performs the analysis process of the search database.</p>
<p>The Maraha system uses the built-in <strong>mahara_analyzer</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-modules/analysis/custom-analyzer/">Read the Elasticsearch instructions</a> if you wish to use a different analyzer.</p>
<p>This setting cannot be changed through the web interface. You may change it by setting a value in your config.php file for the following config variable:</p>
<p><code>$cfg->plugin_search_elasticsearch_analyzer</code>.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you don't change the default "mahara_analyzer"
unless you know what you are doing.</p>
