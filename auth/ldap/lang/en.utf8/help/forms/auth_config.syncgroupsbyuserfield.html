<h3>Sync groups stored as user attributes</h3>
<p>Enable this option if each LDAP user record has an attribute
which indicates a group the user should be in. This setting will
cause the LDAP sync cron to create a group for each unique value
in the specified user attribute (or in those listed in the 
"Acceptable group names" field), and place each user in the
appropriate group (or groups, if they have multiple values for
the attribute).</p>
