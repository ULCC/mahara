<h3>Sync groups automatically via cron job</h3>
<p>Enable this setting to activate a task in the cron which will automatically create and/or update
groups and their membership based on records in the LDAP server. By default, this cron task will execute once
daily at midnight (server time). Edit the record in the "auth_cron" table or use the optional command-line scripts
supplied in htdocs/auth/ldap/cli/ if you wish to schedule it to run at other times or with other settings.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You'll also need to activate the "Sync groups stored as LDAP objects" and/or "Sync groups stored as
user attributes" settings in order for groups to be synced.</p>
<p>Group members can be removed as well as added by this setting. If a group is no longer found in the LDAP
records, all of its members will be removed from the group.</p>
<p>This setting will have no effect if the cron is not running. See the
<a href="http://wiki.mahara.org/System_Administrator's_Guide/Installing_Mahara">installation guide</a> for
instructions on how to set it up.</p>
