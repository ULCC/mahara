<h3>Additional LDAP filter for sync</h3>
<p>Provide an LDAP filter here, and the sync will only see users in
LDAP who match that filter.</p>
<p>Use this setting with caution if you have auto-suspend or auto-delete
enabled, as doing so will cause all user accounts in your institution which
<b>do not</b> match the filter to be suspended or deleted.</p>
<p>Example: uid=user*</p>
