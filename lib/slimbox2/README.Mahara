Slimbox in Mahara
======================

Website: http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2
Version: 2.05

This library is used to overlay images on the page.
It is a clone of Lightbox 2.
(available at http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/)

Changes:

  * Swapped the prev, next, close images for ones without lang strings
on them and adjusted the css to fit new images
  * Changed the 'Image {x} of {y}' string to be supplied by mahara so
can be translated
