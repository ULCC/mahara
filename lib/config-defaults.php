 *
 * LOG_TARGET_SCREEN makes the error messages go to the screen - useful
 * when debugging but not on a live site!
 * LOG_TARGET_ADMIN sends error messages to the screen but only when
 * browsing in the admin section
 * LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG makes the error messages go to the log as specified
 * by the apache ErrorLog directive. It's probably useful to have this on
 * for all log levels.
 * LOG_TARGET_FILE allows you to specify a file that messages will be logged
 * to. It's best to pick a path in dataroot, but note that logfiles tend to get
 * very large over time - so it's advisable to implement some kind of logrotate
 * if you want to leave this on all the time. The other option is to just turn
 * this on when you are getting some kind of error or want to see the logging,
 * and know that you're not going to let the logfile get large.
 *
 * You can combine the targets with bitwise operations,
 * e.g. LOG_TARGET_SCREEN | LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG
 *
 * This configuration is suitable for people running Mahara for the first
 * time. You will immediately see environment errors, and so can correct
