<h3>My skills</h3>
<p>The skills area is divided into three sections: personal, academic and work skills. Skills added here may be included in your pages.</p>
<p>Employers are always interested in what skills you can bring to a role. You can also use this section to display the attributes that you would bring to a collaborative community or working group.</p>
